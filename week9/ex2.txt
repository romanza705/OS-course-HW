Maximum hit/miss ratio possible: The principle is that values repeated constantly after one cycle
Example :1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5

program res:
10
Hits: 5
Misses: 5
Ratio hits to misses: 1.000000


Minimum hit/miss ratio possible: All values in sequence are different
Ex: 1 2 3 4 5


program res:
5
Hits: 0
Misses: 5
Ratio hits to misses: 0.000000
